# ğŸ¤– AAK AI Copilot

The **AAK AI Copilot** is a real-time productivity assistant designed for tracked sessions at AAK Telescience. It silently monitors keyboard and mouse activity, tracks session behavior, and uses Claude (or OpenAI GPT) to:

- Detect idle periods and prompt users
- Score how well a user is sticking to their assigned task
- Log all interactions for auditing, review, or reporting

---

## ğŸ“¦ Features

### ğŸ§  Intelligent Session Monitoring
- Keystroke and mouse tracking via `pynput`
- Idle time detection (triggered after 20+ seconds by default)

### ğŸ’¬ Claude-Powered Guidance
- Sends session data to Claude to get alignment feedback
- Evaluates whether user behavior matches their assigned task

### ğŸ§¾ Logging + Integration
- Real-time logs written to `copilot_log.jsonl`
- Broadcasts live session signals to `live_metrics.json`
- Easily consumed by `aak-ui-overlay` HUD
